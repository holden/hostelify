# Hostelify 

>This a gem which creates an API for booking and pricing data for the following sites:

* Hostelworld
* Hostelbookers
* Gomio (removed too slow to speak of)

Hostelworld's real API is commercial and it sucks to high heaven... it was written as an afterthought by a Rent-a-coder.
Hostelbookers' is also commercial only, but is quite ok.
