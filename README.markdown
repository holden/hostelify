# Hostelify 

>This a gem which creates an API for booking and pricing data for the following sites:

* Hostelworld
* Hostelbookers
* Gomio (removed too slow to speak of)

Hostelworld real API is commercial and it sucks to high heaven... it was written as an afterthought by a Rent-a-coder.
Hostelbookers' is also commercial only, but is quite ok.  Using their commercial API vs. mine for I got a 30% delay (theirs is faster).  
However with hostelworld's, mine is actually faster by 50+%.  Though mine is mostly at price data and not much else.

This is of course for Educational Purposes Only.
