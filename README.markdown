# Well-behaved bots Policy

This gem strictly follows the Well-behaved bots Policy, the standard policy of Google, Yahoo & many other search engines.
If a site owner wishes to give instructions to web robots, including this one, he/she must place a text file called robots.txt in the root of the web site hierarchy (e.g. www.example.com/robots.txt). 
This text file should contain the instructions in a specific format (see examples below). 
Robots that choose to follow the instructions try to fetch this file and read the instructions before fetching any other file from the web site. 
If this file doesnâ€™t exist web robots assume that the web owner wishes to provide no specific instructions.
