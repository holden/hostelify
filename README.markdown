# Hostelify 

>This a gem which creates an API for booking and pricing data for the following sites:

* Hostelworld
* Hostelbookers
* Gomio (removed too slow to speak of)

Hostelworld real API is commercial and it sucks to high heaven... it was written as an afterthought by a Rent-a-coder.
Hostelbookers APT is also commercial only, but it quite ok.  Using their commercial API vs mine for speed I got a 30% delay (theirs is faster).  
However with hostelworld's mine is actually faster than theirs.  Though my usage is aimed mostly at price data and not much else.
